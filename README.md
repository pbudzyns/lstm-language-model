# Language modelling with LSTM Network

This exercise discuses the topic of language modelling. LSTM network will
be trained on a popular PTB Corpus. A number of theoretical aspects
and practical techniques and implementations were discussed. Additionally,
various variants of objective functions will be investigated following the paper
_Labeau, Matthieu, and Shay B. Cohen. "Experimenting with power divergences
for language modeling."_ https://aclanthology.org/D19-1421/
